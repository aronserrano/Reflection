        Having participated in the Data Privacy and Awareness Campaign is an enlightened moment because I now realize more profound meaning why data privacy is important in this digital world of ours. The goal of this campaign was to educate people on the impact of information sharing, consequences of breach incidents and proactive measures that can be done about their most personal form of data.<br><br>

        The campaign starkly focused on data being used and collected by companies, social platforms or banks. The point they made was how much data we release out the moment everyday, from our web-based shopping behaviors to our social communications.<br><br>

        I was most particularly impacted by the interactive workshops. Through such exercises, participants are taken through scenarios of what could happen when data is poorly managed. I learned about phishing scams, identity theft (pagkakakilanlan ng ibang tao), as well as how personal information can surreptitiously be used. One had to sober up from the reality of how easy it is to have one's identity compromised and the far-reaching consequences (mga epekto) that follow. This experiential learning made the risks become concrete and thereby inculcated vigilance in our online activities.<br><br>

        It also provided some practical suggestions about how one might guard their privacy information. However-keeping in mind that I am not your average consumer, and have taken steps that no one would advise anyone to take, to improve my privacy a bit without alarming their mother-I rather enjoyed the focus on doing something mundane that its fans can do. Like using strong, unique passwords-for instance. And two-factor authentication.<br><br>

        The discussion on legislation (batas) and the law regarding data protection was really enlightening. Some of the recent developments about data privacy regulation, including the recent General Data Protection Regulation passed in Europe and some in the United States, were highlighted by speakers. Knowing the legal framework which surrounds data privacy really clarified the roles of persons as well as corporations. It is obvious, though, that while laws may protect the small businessmen and users at large, a great gap between being aware and in compliance still exists, especially among the smaller businesses and the users at large.<br><br>

        Reflecting on the campaign, I personally reach a higher level of personal responsibility regarding how I deal with my data. In relation to my information, now I am more careful about what I share over the internet, as well as taking control and being the most aggressive in controlling my digital footprint. Furthermore, motivated to further share with friends and family what I have learned, I hope to contribute to further developing the awareness campaign for data privacy within my community.<br><br>

        It would thus end up as an unalienable experience in my life going forward: it brought to light before my eyes all the intricate complexities that data privacy embodies in the digital age, which was nowadays outpacing my limited understanding. It equipped me with knowledge and the usage of tools and processes to navigate through this landscape in a more safe and responsible manner. As we continue to rely more and more on technology for our day-to-day lives, we must keep our eyes open and remain vigilant about protecting our personal information. Such an endeavor was not only an event educating people but did call for all of us to take charge of our personal data privacy and work for a more secured digital future.<br><br>
